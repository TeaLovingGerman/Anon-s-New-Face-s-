Simply drag/copy-paste the folder, "images", besides this .txt file into the "game" folder.
Doing so will prompt you to confirm, if you want to overwrite the present images with my modified ones.
Confirm it and you should be good to go.

If you want the old images back, download Snoot Game again from the link below, copy its "images" folder
and paste them into the the copy of the game you already donwloaded.

With that out of the way, enjoy my digital vandalism or do something else. I sure can't stop you.
